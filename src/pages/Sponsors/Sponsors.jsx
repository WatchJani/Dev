            <h2>What is Forem? üå±</h2>
            <p>Forem is the open source community software that powers DEV and other growing communities.</p>
            <p>For more information, please check out Forem.com.</p>
            <hr />
            <h2>Can I set up my own Forem community?</h2>
            <p>
                Absolutely. Forem provides a powerful and extensible way to engage with your community.
                Many developer-facing organizations are in the process of replacing (or supplementing)
                their closed and synchronous-first developer communities ‚Äîtypically on Slack/Discord
                ‚Äî with the open and async-first Forem platform.
            </p>
            <p>Forem is also a great platform for organizing your private ambassador communities and even your internal teams.</p>
            <p>Check out our ‚ÄúGet Started‚Äù page for more information on hosting yourself or getting going immediately with our Forem Cloud option.</p>

                in discussions, and discover products and services.
